## Flag 6: Mr Beep Boop Bot

_Beep boop_, my name is Mr Beep Boop Bot. I have a message for you, but I have only installed the minimal human language module. _So I just used a language more native to me and I hope that you can read it_.

## Flag 7: Decrypt XOR or fail

Can you decrypt the following message that was encrypted using the XOR operation with a key that is 1 byte long?

## Flag 8: Train to Crack Station

I was on the train the other day going to **crack station** when this person came up to me and told me the MD5 hash of their password. "Why would you do something like this?" I asked him, but they just told me that their name was **John** and said "if I was the chosen one I would be able to get his password".

**Can you crack the hash below and get the password for John?**

## **Flag 9: Missing Letter**

Help I have forgotten the end of my encryption key and I cannot decrypt my data!

I know I used **AES-128** using **CBC mode** where the IV was `01020304050607080102030405060708` in **hexadecimal** and the key started off with `harperssecretke`. However. I still cannot decrypt my data below **in hexadecimal format**.

```

**Can you guess the AES key and decrypt the data?**
