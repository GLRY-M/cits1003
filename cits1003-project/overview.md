# Overview

### Availability

The project questions/challenges is available on the CTF flag submission site: [https://labs.cits1003.jinhong.org/](https://labs.cits1003.jinhong.org) on week 6.

### Questions

The project consists of four topics: (1) Linux and Networking, (2) Cryptography (3) Forensics, and (4) Vulnerabilities. Each topic consists of four questions (total 16 questions) with varying difficulties (easy, medium and hard). Easy questions are 10 points, Medium questions are 20 points and Hard questions are 25 points. The points will add up to 250 points for 25% of your unit grade.


### Your tasks and how the project is graded

Your task is to find flags for the provided 16 questions to obtain as many points as possible (the format for the flags is: UWA{xxx} where xxx is the flag you have found). Please note that, questions in the projects normally extend the questions you have seen in the labs, which means you are expected to carry out your own research on top of the knowledge you have gained from lectures and labs to find the flags.

In addition, you will submit a write-up report explaining step-by-step in detail how a flag is obtained. Marking rubrics can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wlSfCf2KAC-q_y_hm7Ss0brH23rOGXOoydB7ewdm8sU/edit?usp=sharing). 

You may be requested for an interview for us to clarify any misunderstandings found in your report. If you fail to organise a time to have an interview, you may lose marks for the questions we need clarifications. We will make a reasonable attempt to organise an interview session.

Your write-up report (a single PDF file) is submitted on LMS, where you will find a report submission page. From LMS, you can submit multiple times until due date and only the latest submission will be graded. If your submission has a high similarity with that of others, we will perform a manual check and decide whether it is an academic miscondut.  

### Duration

The project starts from 8 April (week 6) and will close on 5pm 20 May (week 12). There should be plenty of time to complete the project.

### Getting help

Yes, you can ask for help during the lab sessions but the lab facilitators won't be giving you the answers directly but give you a general direction to explore from. You can also discuss on Teams, but make sure you are not giving away answers or workflow that leads to answers directly. You are also welcome to discuss the general approach to solving the challenges, but you should not share flags or provide walkthroughs. Penalties are severe as this falls into academic misconduct.

### Academic conduct

Do not seek to get the flags from anyone else. &#x20;
Do not share the flags you have found. &#x20;
Do not copy the report. &#x20;
Do not share the report. &#x20;
If you are unsure whether what you planning to do would be academic misconduct or not, check with the lab facilitators or the unit coordinator.&#x20;

### Final reminder

Please do not seek to get flags from your friends/classmates/others, as it compromises your learning which will affect your future studies significantly (i.e., things only get harder so you need to know how to do things on your own).

Please do not share the flags you found, it jeopardizes their learning which also significantly affects their future studies.
