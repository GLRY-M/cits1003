# CITS1003 Introduction to Cybersecurity

These labs are intended to provide a practical complement to the CITS1003 Introduction to Cybersecurity course. To enhance the experience, we are going to run the assessment part as a "Capture The Flag" \(CTF\) event. This involves creating an account on the CTF server here &lt;some address&gt;

As a result of the exercises you will do, you will be asked to find "flags" which are text and of the form CITS1003{th13\_15\_@ FL@G}. Once you find the flag, you simply enter it in for the appropriate Lab challenge.
