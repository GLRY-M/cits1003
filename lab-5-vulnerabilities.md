# Lab 5: Vulnerabilities

## What is a vulnerability?

In cybersecurity terms, a vulnerability is \(according to NIST\):

> "A weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source.‚Äù

That actually doesn't help us very much because just because a threat source might exploit a weakness, it might not have an impact on the organisation in any noticeable way. Vulnerabilities are usually quantified in some way using a range of different characteristics and severity. Once such scheme is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System \(CVSS Scores\) that provides a range of between 0-10 to represent the severity of the vulnerability. Vulnerabilities are identified by different organisations using their own identifiers but there is a standard one provided by the MITRE organisation called the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures \(CVE\) identifier. For example, the CVE CVE-2017-00144 \([https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2017-0144](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2017-0144)\) relates to a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows file sharing protocols that was exploited by the WannaCry ransomware. This vulnerability was identified by Microsoft as MS17-010.
